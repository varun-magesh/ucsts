## How do I make a public comment to the UC Regents?

### Setting Up an Appointment

Email [publiccomment@ucop.edu](mailto:publiccomment@ucop.edu) with something similar to this:

> Dear UCOP,
>
> My name is [Marty McFly] and I am an [undergraduate] at UC [Hill Valley]. I am concerned about [disruption of the time-space continuum] funded by the University of California, and would like to speak to the Regents about this on January [19th, 20th, or 21st].
> Please confirm if I will be able to talk on this date or another public comment session. My phone number is [...].
>
> Many thanks,
>
> [Marty McFly]

### Date and Time

The Public Comment Sessions are scheduled for Wednesday, March 17th at 8:30am and Thursday, March 18th at 8:30am. Pick whichever day works best for you, and be available at that time.

### Issue of Concern

The Regents try to hear about a variety of issues during these sessions. “Fortunately”, animal agriculture intersects with *innumerable *important causes which are cleanly listed in the [Justifications document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmxbPmfiWJHE8vf4HvCWdOaTd2t9QSAnWc-AwwsfXBk/edit?usp=sharing). Choose an issue and fill in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c1XkkwNOxyPVltoktD6t0_bKLjBaPFPyLCns21hkL-U/edit#gid=0) so we don’t overlap. Prepare to speak on this issue.

### Making Your Comment

**Time limit: 1 minute (usually)**

**Template/Script:**

Hello, my name is [insert name] and I’m a [student at UCX]. I’d like to urge the Regents to review the Stop the Slaughter Open Letter submitted several times. The letter urges the UC System to consider the impact of animal agriculture in causing and exacerbating the issue of [insert issue here]

*or*

I would like to pull the UC’s attention to the Stop the Slaughter Open Letter that has been sent twice to the Board of Regents, to urge the UC system to address it’s unjustifiable support of animal agriculture in light of the [insert issue here] …. Again, I urge the Regents to take this issue seriously and respond to the Open Letter sent out.

Example:
Hello, my name is [Lynnea Doshi] and I’m a student at UCLA. I would like to pull the UC’s attention to the Open Letter that has been sent twice to the Board of Regents, and has not yet received a response, to urge the UC system to address it’s unjustifiable support of animal agriculture in light of its immense contributions to exacerbating the issue of food insecurity.
41% of land in the contiguous United States is used for[ feeding livestock](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/). It has been argued that [800 million people](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) could be fed by the grain that is given to livestock in the United States alone. Food insecurity is found in every county in the United States, but it [disproportionately](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/food-insecurity) affects certain populations such as communities of color, low-income people, and people with disabilities. Still, U.S. taxpayers give [38 billion dollars](https://cleantechnica.com/2016/12/19/animal-agriculture-subsidies-threaten-planet/#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20American%20taxpayers%20subsidize,in%20hidden%20costs%20on%20taxpayers.) worth of subsidies every year to the animal food system, ensuring that fast food restaurants thrive while nutritious plant-based foods remain unattainable for many. [44%](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/july16/e1attach.pdf) of all UC students are currently food insecure.

Again, I urge the Regents to take this issue seriously and respond to the Open Letter sent out, to pave the way for a more just food system.
