1. Send a message to Eric Pollack ([eric.pollack@ucop.edu](mailto:eric.pollack@ucop.edu)), head of UC purchasing, letting them know that you oppose the Harris Ranch contract, and would support negotiations with plant-based suppliers instead.

	Make the message your own! Make sure to let them know that you oppose the contract extension, and how you are affiliated with UC or California. Include a [link to the investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfB192xAkrA) to encourage UC employees to understand degree and magnitude of the cruelty that the University sponsors.

2. Sign our Harris Ranch Petition to add your voice to our organization’s messages to the University.

> I urge the UC Office of the President and UC campuses to not renew Harris Ranch’s contract, and instead pursue procurement contracts for plant-based foods to support UC’s commitments to a more just, equitable, and sustainable world.
>
> Signed,
