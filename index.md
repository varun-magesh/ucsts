We are a collective of University of California students working towards a just and sustainable food system.
We inform students, mobilize activists, and petition UC to end the university’s support for violence towards our fellow beings.

Our current initiatives are to push for a system-wide [commitment to plant-based foods](/sign) and to [end UC’s contract with Harris Ranch](/harris), one of the worst abusers and polluters in California.
Learn more, reach out, and support our work [on our website](/more) and [our Instagram](www.instagram.com/ucstoptheslaughter).
We also welcome new members to our team --- if you're interested in contributing, please let us know by filling out [this form](/join).
