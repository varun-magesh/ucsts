Non-human animals are exploited from the day they are born and until their last moments on earth. Exploited in every way possible. Treated like machines. This is a nightmare they can’t wake up from. Most don’t ever get to feel the sunlight against their skin or the comfort of their mothers. The University of California spends tens of millions of our dollars every year supporting this cruelty.
The true reality behind the food the University of California supplies is made of nightmares. We’ve been fed the myth that our “food” came from loving farms whose animals lived in idyllic conditions, ignoring the tremendous suffering this industry inflicts on trillions of victims.


It takes one slaughterhouse or factory farm footage to change our preconceived notions of what we call food. Cows crying for their children who were taken away from them, animals screaming at the top of their lungs in the slaughterhouse, and women pigs who are put in cages where they can’t even turn around are the reality of animal agriculture.
This is how the industry treats mothers: as machines, as a means to an end. When they are no longer of “value,” they are murdered. No one wants Wilber to be killed in *Charlotte’s Web*. We are rooting for his survival, yet we often don’t realize the role food choices play in this vicious cycle.

Bearing witness (comforting animals before they are about to get slaughtered) can help make this connection between one’s food preferences and the beautiful sentient beings behind those choices. At Farmer Johns in Los Angeles, we often give water to pigs in trucks who are about to be murdered.

Often, pigs will fight each other for water because they have been without water for days. Farmer John’s doesn’t want to waste any resources on them. Sometimes, they just want to be petted. Pigs have come up to me for that sole purpose, to be comforted. One pig even licked me as I was petting her.
After all human beings have done to them, they are willing to see the good in us. It’s beautifully tragic. The University of California must stop providing massive support to this unfathomably cruel industry.
